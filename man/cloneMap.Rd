}
\arguments{
\item{tree.mat}{A phylogenetic tree matrix with two columns and one row per 
phylogenetic relationship (column1 = parent, column2 = child). All clones
must be contained in the tree or they will not be plotted (see example data).}

\item{CCF.data}{A table indicating CCFs for each clone in the tree (column
names are "clones" and "CCF", see example data).}

\item{clone_map}{Instead of providing a tree and CCF table you may provide
a `clone_map` object which has previously been outputted by setting 
`output.Clone.map.obj` as TRUE. This contains data specifying tree structure
and the positions of clones. When inputting a tree and a CCF table, clone 
positions are semi-randomly generated but when inputting a `clone_map` postions
will be the identical each time as the postions are recorded in the input and 
once the `clone_map` has been generated the plotting is far quicker.}

\item{output.Clone.map.obj}{If TRUE output a clone_map object containing
informtion on the positions of clones. This object can be saved and repeatly 
provided back to the `clone_map` argument of this function to reproduce precisely 
the same plot and once the `clone_map` has been generated the plotting is far 
quicker.}

\item{plot.data}{Plot the cloneMap visualisation now. This may not be desirable if
`output.Clone.map.obj` is set to TRUE.}

\item{high_qualty_mode}{This activates several mechanisms to ensure high quality plots
at the expense of longer running times, particularly so for some input data. These
mechanisms attempt to aviod plots where the same clone seperates into several islands,
and hence is not continuous with itself, as well as interweaving of clones. If TRUE Track
will also be TRUE unless Track is explicited set to FALSE.}

\item{track}{Provide extra feedback on progress of function. Default is FALSE in normal mode but TRUE in high quialty mode.}

\item{brewer.palette}{A qualitative colour pallette from the `RColourBrewer` package to use for the
clones.}

\item{clone.cols}{A named vector specifying hexidecimal colours for all clones in your 
input (see example). This allows you to keep consistent colours for the same clone 
accross several plots with different inputs, for instance if you wish to plot cloneMaps
for each of several samples from the same tumour.}

\item{border.colour}{The colour of the clone borders.}

\item{border.thickness}{The thickness of the clone borders.}

\item{resolution.index}{This indicates the resolution of the model representing clonal
growth. More precisely it is the diameter of the rasterised matrix in which each point
represents a position where a clone can reside. A higher resolution index will allow more
precise positioning of clones but also increase running time.}

\item{smoothing.par}{Smoothing parameter for the clones. Edges of the clones are smoothed
for visual appeal. The higher this parameter the more smoothing will occur.}

\item{repeat.limit}{When `high_qualty_mode` is TRUE the function will test each clone for 
continuity (i.e. that there are not multiple islands or patches of the same clone) and if
so it will plot this clone and all its sisters again to attempt to avoid this
as clone positions are semi-randomly generated. The `repeat.limit` indicates the maximum number of 
allowed repeats before the function will output a warning and continue with the plot.
These repeats increase run time significantly when high_quality_mode` is TRUE. After two 
repeats the function will use various mechanisms to decrease the probability of non-continuous
clones even further but at the expense of even longer run times.}

\item{space_fraction}{When an unrooted tree is provided how much much of the plot should be white space.
White space indicates non-mutated tissue and hence the density of the clones. Default is NA in which case
the amount of white space will be determined by the CCFs provided i.e. if all the root clone CCFs add up to
60% then 40% of the plot is white space. This is limited however at 70% for athletics. When the 
space fraction is specified the CCFs for an unrooted tree become relative to amount of non-white space
which is available.}

\item{tissue_border}{When a tree is unrooted, should a border be draw to make clear the edge of the tissue. 
Default is FALSE.}
}
\value{
A `clone_map` object will be returned if `output.Clone.map.obj` is TRUE
containing information on clonal positions and tree structure. This output can 
be inputted using the `clone_map` argument to repeat the same plot many times.
}
\description{
Function to represent somatic clones present in a tissue accounting for clone
size, ie the Cancer Cell Fraction (CCF), and for phylogenetic relationships 
between clones

\examples{
# example objects provided in env after loading package #

cloneMap( tree_example, CCFs_example_1 )
cloneMap( tree_example, CCFs_example_2 ) 


# Use a clone_map object to  plot cloneMap reproducibility #

clone_map_eg <- cloneMap( tree_example, CCFs_example_2, 
                          output.Clone.map.obj = TRUE, plot.data = FALSE )
cloneMap( clone_map = clone_map_eg )


# specify colours #
# plot two samples from the same tumour so the clone colours match #

cloneMap( tree_example, CCFs_example_1, clone.cols = clone_colours_example )
cloneMap( tree_example, CCFs_example_2, clone.cols = clone_colours_example )

# Can also be used with tree containing unrelated clones i.e. unrooted trees #
# such as is common is data derived from normal tissues: #

cloneMap( tree.mat = tree_example_poly, 
CCF.data = CCF_example_poly )

cloneMap( tree.mat = tree_example_poly, 
CCF.data = CCF_example_poly,
tissue_border = TRUE)

# Here space_fraction indicates that 70\% of the plot area should be white space #
# indicating that only 70\% of cells are wild type.

cloneMap( tree.mat = tree_example_poly, 
CCF.data = CCF_example_poly,
tissue_border = TRUE,
space_fraction = 0.7 )
