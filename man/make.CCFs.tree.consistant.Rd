\title{Function to correct CCFs when sum of daughter CCFs > parent CCF}
\usage{
make.CCFs.tree.consistant(
  tree.mat,
  CCF.data,
  warning.limit = 1,
  parent.adjust = 1,
  decrease.daughters = TRUE,
  increase.parents = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree.mat}{a phylogenetic tree matrix with two column specifying 'parent' (column 1) and child (column 2)}

\item{CCF.data}{a table of clone CCFs with column 1 (named 'clone') specfying clone names and 
column 2 (name 'CCF') specifying CCFs as either fractions or percetnages}

\item{warning.limit}{If CCF of daughters is significantly > than the parent this may indicate the tree is 
incorrect. This parameter specified the ratio of daughter : parent CCFs that will trigger a warning. Default 
is set to 1 hence any parent  with daughters > its CCF will trigger a warning (indicating how much greater 
the daughter CCF is than the parent)}

\item{parent.adjust}{what fraction of parent to increase daughters to, default is 1}

\item{decrease.daughters}{Do you want to decrease the daughter CCF to account for instances where daughter 
CCF > parent CCF}

\item{increase.parents}{Do you want to increase the parent CCF to account for instances where daughter 
CCF > parent CCF}
}
