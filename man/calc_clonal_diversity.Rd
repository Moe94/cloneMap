\title{function to calculate shannon or simpson diversity of clonal 
prevalence from CCF table input}
\usage{
calc_clonal_diversity(CCF.data, tree, method = "shannon")
}
\arguments{
\item{CCF.data}{a table of clone CCFs with column 1 (named 'clone') specifying clone names and 
column 2 (name 'CCF') specifying CCFs as either fractions or percentages}

\item{tree}{a phylogenetic tree matrix with two column specifying 'parent' (column 1) and child (column 2)}

\item{method}{which method of diversity calculation should be used. These are borrows from the `diversity` 
function of the `vegan` package and can be "shannon", "simpson" or "invsimpson"}
}
\description{
clonal prevalence indicates, for each clone,
what percentage of cells actually contain its
precise genotype (i.e. do not also have any other
additional mutations in subclones). Prevalence
 for all clones should sum 100% in a rooted tree.
